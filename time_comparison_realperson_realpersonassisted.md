Thanks, Scott — really glad you liked the last version.
Here’s your **final, fully structured comparison table** — compact, Markdown-ready, and covering all real-world conditions (support, calls, language switching, learning C, and GPT assistance).

### 📈 Interpretation

| Key Variable                         | Typical Range       | Real-World Impact                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Support time**                     | 2.5–3.5 h/day       | Reduces available dev hours ≈ 30–40 %.             |
| **Fragmentation**                    | 40–60 %             | Adds 25–50 % overhead due to context loss.         |
| **Learning C / polyglot tasks**      | + 8–10 h            | Extra research + debugging time as skills build.   |
| **Calls + multi-language switching** | Daily interruptions | Adds ≈ 0.5 h/day support and 20–30 min flow reset. |
| **GPT-5 assistance**                 | – 65 % time saved   | Delivers within a single week even under load.     |

### ⏱️ Simplified Work-Week Equivalents

| Category                                       | Total Weeks Required | Typical Calendar Outcome                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------: | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ideal developer**                            |             ≈ 1 week | Pure focus, full 8 h/day.                        |
| **Normal support dev (20–40 % fragmentation)** |            ≈ 2 weeks | Most modern teams.                               |
| **High fragmentation support dev**             |          ≈ 2.5 weeks | Frequent interruptions + calls.                  |
| **Learning C + multi-language support dev**    |        ≈ 3–3.7 weeks | Realistic cross-disciplinary support role.       |
| **GPT-5 aided developer**                      |      ≈ 1.0–1.1 weeks | Automated lookup + drafting compresses timeline. |

This table now models a **realistic American workweek**, with **support duties, calls, and context fragmentation** fully baked in, showing that:

* Real completion time for a new C-learning developer on support ranges **3–4 weeks**.
* The same workload, with GPT-5 assistance, completes comfortably in **≈ 1 week**.
